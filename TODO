Brainstorming ideas.
----------------------------

- Function for element lists.
- Optimize related fields, creating components in the foreignkeyfield?
	You create the foreignkeyfield, use methods for create related_fields for models and add components to model?, now, new components fields created on fly. Well, its don't use many cpu why is simple aliasing with & and a new component is not created.
-A function for generate different switch for admin?.
-Engine for create very simple urls, a frontend for make_fancy_url

Possibles bugs.
